/home/leu/Documents/projects/fyp/dawn/src/dawn/node/binding/GPUDevice.cpp:188: UNREACHABLE: operator()() WGPUDeviceLostReason_InstanceDropped

Amber commit e570e1c works perfectly (apart from minor bugs which I can fix)

commit 592282b onwards I get an error for a simple webgpu program



2.

old bug, abseil crash. maybe fixed now bc of compiler, or corentin's abseil roll?

is it because of the compiler? check commit in your bug report. old dawn + abseil commit.

Lost because new bugs have shown up!



3.

fix the odd bugs? full api coverage? report bugs you can find now?













With this bug re-creation:
- Is the compiler responsible for this abseil crash?
- Is the compiler responsible for this GPUDevice bug?

abseil bug report is after that commit. so either abseil crashes before gpudevice bug, or compiler is responsible for gpudevice bug?



CHECK OLD COMMIT NORMAL, DO YOU GET UNREACHABLE BUG? YES, IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPILER

CHECK LATEST COMMIT, ARE ABSEIL BUGS FIXED? STILL GET GENERATIONTYPE ABSEIL ERROR
